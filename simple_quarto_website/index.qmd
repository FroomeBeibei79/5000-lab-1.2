This is an inline math equation: <span style="font-size: 120%;">
$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$</span>.


The area of a circle with radius \(r\) is given by the formula:

$$
[A = \pi r^2]
$$

Where:

- \(A\) is the area of the circle.
  
- (pi) is approximately 3.14159.
  
- \(r\) is the radius of the circle.

This approach enables you to use the same bibliography with different citation
styles without having to change anything about your document or the bibliography itself apart from the bibliography style when your paper is finally compiled
for print.
